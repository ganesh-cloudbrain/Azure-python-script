### Requirements for Script Implementation on Azure

#### **1. Project Overview**

The project requires implementing a Python script to be executed using Azure Functions. The script will scrape a web page, download files, store them, and extract information from XML files. File storage will be managed via Azure Blob Storage, and extracted data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on Azure.

#### **2. Script Details**

- **Language**: Python
- **Functionality**: 
  - Scrape a specific web page.
  - Download files from the web page.
  - Store downloaded files in Azure Blob Storage.
  - Extract information from XML files and store the extracted data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Dependencies**: Requests, BeautifulSoup4, xml.etree.ElementTree, psycopg2 (or any other library needed for interacting with PostgreSQL).

#### **3. Azure Functions**

- **Plan Type**: Consumption Plan.
- **Trigger**: 
  - The script should execute every hour.
  - It should also be manually executable via an HTTP call.
- **Resource Configuration**: 
  - Maximum execution time: 50 minutes.
  - Memory: 2 GB (configurable as needed).
- **Execution Environment**: Python 3.9.

#### **4. Azure Blob Storage**

- **Purpose**: 
  - Store files downloaded from the web page.
  - Store processed files (XML) and their results.
- **Storage Requirements**:
  - Creation of a specific container for input files.
  - Creation of a specific container for processed files.
- **Access and Security**: 
  - Access to the containers should be restricted to the Azure Function and authorized users.
  - Use of Shared Access Signatures (SAS) to provide temporary access to external users.
  - Encryption of data at rest.

#### **5. Azure PostgreSQL Database**

- **Purpose**: 
  - Store data extracted from processed XML files.
- **Database Configuration**:
  - PostgreSQL version: PostgreSQL 13.
  - Initial database size: 5 GB (scalable as needed).
  - Automatic backup and recovery configuration.
- **Access and Security**:
  - Secure access configuration from the Azure Function using secure connection credentials.
  - Implement firewall rules to allow access only from authorized IP addresses.
  - Encryption of data at rest and in transit.

#### **6. Security and Compliance**

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Implementation of Azure AD to manage access to Azure Functions and associated resources.
- **Encryption**:
  - Data at rest in Blob Storage and PostgreSQL should be encrypted.
  - Data in transit should use HTTPS/TLS.

#### **7. Monitoring and Logging**

- **Monitoring Requirements**:
  - Configuration of Application Insights to monitor the execution of Azure Functions.
  - Detailed logging of errors and successful script executions.
- **Alerts**:
  - Configuration of alerts for script execution failures.
  - Alerts for anomalous changes in database performance.

#### **8. Support and Maintenance**

- **Documentation**:
  - Detailed instructions for deploying and configuring the script and services on Azure.
  - User manual for manual script execution.
- **Support**:
  - Ongoing support services for troubleshooting and security updates.

#### **9. Additional Information**

- **Budget**: Provide details on the available budget for the implementation.
- **Timeline**: Specify expected timelines for the complete implementation of the project.
- **Scalability**: Considerations for automatic scaling in case of increased workload.
